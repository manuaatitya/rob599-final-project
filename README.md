# rob599-final-project

Some general rules for the repository (can be changed later)

- Don't edit anything without pull requests in the master branch
- Don't edit the NeRF supervision public repository
- Create a new folder and do the all required changes there

Tasks that I can think of for the project


- [ ] Reproduce the results
    - [ ] Figure out if the dataset is sufficient
    - [ ] If dataset is not sufficient figure out next steps
    
- [ ] Create like a flowchart or ipynb file for documentation
- [ ] Think about extension steps (later)

    - master - main branch "create pull requests for any changes"
    
    branch for editing changes specific to collaborators
